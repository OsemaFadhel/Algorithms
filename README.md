Collection of different Sorting and Searching Algorithms in C++

<h1 align="center"> Sort ðŸ”€ ðŸ“¶ </h1>

| Name | Time Complexity | Short Description |
|:-------------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/OsemaFadhel/Algorithms/tree/main/sorting) | O(n^2) | Compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are in the intended order. |
| [Ford-Johnson / Merge-Insertion Sort](https://github.com/OsemaFadhel/Algorithms/tree/main/sorting/ford_johnson) | O(nmlog n) | recursively divides the list into smaller segments, sorting each segment and merging them in a way that minimizes comparisons. |
| [Merge Sort](https://github.com/OsemaFadhel/Algorithms/tree/main/sorting) | O(n log n) | Divide and conquers algorithm, it divides the given array into equal parts and then merges the 2 sorted parts.  |
| [Quick Sort](https://github.com/OsemaFadhel/Algorithms/tree/main/sorting) | O(n log n) | Divide and Conquer that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot by placing the pivot in its correct position in the sorted array. |



<h1 align="center"> Search ðŸ”Ž</h1>

| Name | Time Complexity | Short Description |
|:-------------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| [Linear Search](https://github.com/OsemaFadhel/Algorithms/tree/main/searching) | O(N) | Sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched. |
| [Binary Search](https://github.com/OsemaFadhel/Algorithms/tree/main/searching) | O(log n) | Algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. |
